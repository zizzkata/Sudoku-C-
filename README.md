# Sudoku-C
Project showcasing how a recursive function can solve Sudoku and how this can be optimized by searching for a solution in parallel!

Done by me!

!   I have left a lot of unused methods which at some point were in use, but didn't get into the final solution.

!   Still you can check them out and play with them.
